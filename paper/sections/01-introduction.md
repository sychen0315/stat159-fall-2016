## Introduction

The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger  datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducible research, which is published with data and code, allows others to verify the findings and build upon them. So by taking this class, I hope to learn more about how to conduct reproducible research.

There are several tools which play important roles in reproducible research, including but not limited to Makefile, Git, GitHub, pandoc and Markdown. Some of them are just learned from this class. So in this project, I will practice using these tools and discuss their roles in this project in this paper. The scope of this project is to write a paper about how to use these tools to do this project.

Also for those who are not familiar with these tools or even not familiar with coding, I hope this paper will be helpful for them to get a better understanding of reproducible research.
